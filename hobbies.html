        <h2 style="text-align: center;">HOBBIES</h2>
        <p> My hobbies mostly consist of playing video games, and roller blading, this also include board games, and anything that has to do with coffee. I like Video games because its always been a part of my life ever since i was young starting of with those big blocky computers and floppy disk readers. I like roller blading because I used to use ice skates, trying out hockey, Recently i cant ride on ice and so i tried roller blading; altough similar both have major differences but i enjoy both. Lastly i just really like coffee.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">INTERESTS</h2>
        <p> Im interested in many things, like philosophy, minecraft automatic farms, youtube lets plays. It really all depends, such as the case of 2018 when i was intereste in tiktok but gradually lose interest; the same with board games as i love playing them but the amount of time invested to play with others is too large for a student.</p>
