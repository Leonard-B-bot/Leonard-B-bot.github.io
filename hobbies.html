        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p> My hobbies mostly consist of playing video games, and roller blading, this also include board games, and anything that has to do with coffee. I like Video games because its always been a part of my life ever since i was young starting of with those big blocky computers and floppy disk readers. I like roller blading because I used to use ice skates, trying out hockey, Recently i cant ride on ice and so i tried roller blading; altough similar both have major differences but i enjoy both. Lastly i just really like coffee.</p>
